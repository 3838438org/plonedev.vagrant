plonedev_vagrant
================

A Vagrant setup for a plone-development virtualbox.

This is an exploration of feasibility for having a distributable Vagrant kit that
will provision a virtual box with a running Plone that may be used for development
purposes.

Part of the goal is to get the *.cfg files and ./src directory set up to be editable
from the host side and to have shell or .bat commands to start, fg, stop Plone from
the host side.
